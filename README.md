Polygon and line clipping and offsetting library

Polygon Clipper is a library to generate various boolean operations (Union, Difference, XOR, etc.) on arbitrary 2D polygons, e.g. calculate the area in which two polygons overlap.

Itâ€™s a Kotlin portation of the Clipper project developed by [Angus Johnson](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php), which as an implementation of the algorithm proposed by [Bala R. Vatti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatti_clipping_algorithm).

This port based on [C# Clipper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/) version 6.4.2.
